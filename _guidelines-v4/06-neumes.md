The MEI Neume Module represents the communityâ€™s attempt to create a standardized set of rules that encapsulate in a logical, systematic, and unequivocal way the musical information represented and conveyed by Western European neumatic notations (beginning with the late ninth century and continuing to the printed books of the twentieth). This chapter describes the elements, model classes, and attribute classes that are part of the MEI.neumes module.
